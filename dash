3. Can track multiple actions per org
4. Updates status as actions progress

### Key Insights
- "Which orgs need immediate attention?"
- "Who is responsible for addressing each issue?"
- "Are our interventions working?"
- "Which orgs have improved the most?"

### Drillthrough Configuration
**Enable drillthrough on these visuals:**

## Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Navy: #003B5C (Headers, primary elements)
- Light Blue: #3498DB (Accents, interactive elements)
- White: #FFFFFF (Backgrounds)
- Light Gray: #ECF0F1 (Secondary backgrounds)

**Data Colors:**
- Success/Positive: #27AE60 (Green)
- Warning/Caution: #F39C12 (Orange)
- Alert/Negative: #E74C3C (Red)
- Neutral: #7F8C8D (Gray)
- Info: #3498DB (Blue)

**Sequential Palettes:**
- Blues: #DCEEF3 → #003B5C (for tenure)
- Greens: #D4EFDF → #196F3D (for retention)
- Reds: #FADBD8 → #A93226 (for attrition)

### Typography
- **Headers:** Segoe UI Bold, 16-18pt
- **KPI Values:** Segoe UI Bold, 36-48pt
- **Labels:** Segoe UI, 10-11pt
- **Data Labels:** Segoe UI, 9-10pt

### Conditional Formatting Standards

**Attrition Rate:**
- Green: <8%
- Yellow: 8-12%
- Red: >12%

**Retention Rate:**
- Green: >92%
- Yellow: 88-92%
- Red: <88%

**Risk Score:**
- Green (Low): 0-40
- Yellow (Medium): 41-70
- Red (High): 71-100

**Trend Indicators:**
- ↑ Red - Worsening
- → Yellow - Flat
- ↓ Green - Improving

### Visual Best Practices
1. **Limit visuals per page:** 6-8 maximum
2. **Use white space:** Don't overcrowd
3. **Consistent sizing:** Align visual edges
4. **Data labels:** Only on key values, not every data point
5. **Tooltips:** Add rich tooltips with additional context
6. **Mobile optimization:** Ensure key metrics visible on mobile

### Accessibility
- High contrast between text and background
- Don't rely solely on color (use icons/shapes too)
- Alt text for all visuals
- Font size minimum 10pt
- Test in high contrast mode

**Total Tooltip-Enabled Visuals:** 72 visuals across 9 pages

**Design Principle:**
- Tooltips provide **contextual insights** without cluttering the main visual
- Show **trends**, **breakdowns**, or **comparisons** not visible in the main chart
- Keep tooltips **concise** (400x300px typical) and **fast-loading** (<1 second)
- Use tooltips to **reduce on-screen clutter** while maintaining information richness

### Implementation Workflow

**Step 1: Create Drillthrough Pages**
1. Build Org Deep Dive page ([DRILLTHROUGH_PAGES_SPECIFICATION.md](DRILLTHROUGH_PAGES_SPECIFICATION.md))
2. Build Center Deep Dive page
3. Build Series Deep Dive page
4. Configure drillthrough fields on each page
5. Test drillthrough navigation and back button

**Step 2: Create Tooltip Pages**
1. Build all 10 tooltip pages ([TOOLTIP_PAGES_SPECIFICATION.md](TOOLTIP_PAGES_SPECIFICATION.md))
2. Set canvas size to Tooltip type
3. Enable "Allow use as tooltip" in page settings
4. Optimize visuals for fast loading

**Step 3: Build Main Dashboard Pages**
1. Build all 10 dashboard pages (this document)
2. Configure visuals according to specifications

**Step 4: Apply Drillthrough**
1. For each visual listed in "Drillthrough Configuration" sections:
   - Open visual Format pane → Drillthrough
   - Enable "Allow using drillthrough on this visual"
   - Set target drillthrough pages
   - Configure drillthrough fields
2. Test right-click drillthrough from each visual

**Step 5: Apply Tooltips**
1. For each visual listed in "Tooltip Assignments" tables:
   - Open visual Format pane → Tooltip
   - Set Type: "Report page"
   - Select appropriate tooltip page from dropdown
2. Test hover interaction for each visual
3. Verify tooltip data matches hovered element

**Step 6: Testing**
- [ ] All 28 drillthrough-enabled visuals navigate correctly
- [ ] Back button returns to correct source page
- [ ] All 72 tooltip-enabled visuals show correct tooltip page
- [ ] Tooltips display correct data for hovered element
- [ ] Tooltips load within 1 second
- [ ] Drillthrough pages respect filter context
- [ ] Multi-level drillthrough works (main → org → series)

### User Experience Design

**Progressive Disclosure Strategy:**

**Level 1: Main Visual** (Quick glance)
- High-level metric or trend
- Example: "Attrition Rate: 12.5%"

**Level 2: Tooltip** (Hover for context)
- Breakdown, trend, or comparison
- Example: Tooltip shows 12-month trend, vol vs non-vol split, comparison to average
- **Interaction:** Hover over visual

**Level 3: Drillthrough** (Deep dive analysis)
- Comprehensive analysis for selected entity
- Example: Full org analysis with 10+ visuals showing all metrics
- **Interaction:** Right-click → Drillthrough

**Layering Benefits:**
- Reduces visual clutter on main pages
- Provides information on-demand
- Supports different user needs (executive vs analyst)
- Maintains performance (tooltips/drillthrough load only when needed)

---

### Maintenance & Updates

**Quarterly Review:**
1. **Drillthrough Pages:**
   - Verify all measures still calculate correctly
   - Update Top N filters if org structure changes
   - Add new visuals if user feedback requests
   - Check page load performance

2. **Tooltip Pages:**
   - Validate tooltip load times (<1 second)
   - Update comparison benchmarks (agency averages)
   - Refresh conditional formatting thresholds
   - Test tooltips after any data model changes

3. **Dashboard Pages:**
   - Review tooltip assignments - are users finding them helpful?
   - Check if any new visuals need tooltips or drillthrough
   - Validate that drillthrough fields still match data model
   - Update documentation if pages change

**When Data Model Changes:**
- [ ] Validate all drillthrough fields still exist
- [ ] Test drillthrough navigation end-to-end
- [ ] Check tooltip filter context (ensure tooltips show correct data)
- [ ] Verify relationships support drillthrough/tooltip filtering

**User Feedback Loop:**
- Track which drillthrough pages are most used (Power BI usage metrics)
- Survey users: "Are tooltips helpful or distracting?"
- Iterate on tooltip content based on user requests
- Add new drillthrough pages if specific deep dives are frequently requested
